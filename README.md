# NewNewExporterDynamics (old)
This page is an online repository for RAship for Professor Kim Ruhl by Xing Xu. The original paper is the New Exporter Dynamics by Ruhl and Willis published in Journal of International Economics in 2017. For a new version of the model, I call this new new exporter dynamics. The codes are written in Matlab. The main file is recursive_programming.m and simulation.m, performing value function iterations and simulations accordingly. Right now the codes are simply trying to replicate the results. More info to be added in the future.
